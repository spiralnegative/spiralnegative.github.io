It was an emotional year with some big changes. There were days when I was totally uninspired to shoot for my [1 Second Everyday](http://1se.co/) video but I was excited to see the result as I am every year :)

### Music

* [**Bathroom Song** by Hot Flash Heat Wave](https://youtu.be/fZs_9xgDLoY)
* [**Holy Moly, Rock n' Rolly, Guacamole!** by Lazy Ghost](https://youtu.be/Q4MFBOBrHq4)

### Software

* Video editing - [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/)
* Compression - [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) with `-vcodec h264` and `-acodec copy`
