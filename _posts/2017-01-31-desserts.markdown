Baking has been one of my hobbies for a few years. I am not sure when did it happen but I feel like I've always been interested in cooking. With the rise of the Internet, providing an endless resource of recipes next to my cookbooks, I started cooking different desserts and discovered I mostly enjoy baking muffins and cookies. I decided to upload the photos of my favourite desserts - if you're curious about a recipe, just drop a comment.
